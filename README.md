# android-jenkins
A basic Android Studio project using Gradle for building and Robolectric, Robotium, Mockito and JaCoCo for testing, capable of being ran on Jenkins or Travis-CI. This was meant to ensure that the testing tools for the Android portion of my group's CMPT 371 project, [geosource](https://github.com/knames/geosource) would work properly.
